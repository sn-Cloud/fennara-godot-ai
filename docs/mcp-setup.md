Connect an external AI app to Fennara's Godot tools. The app keeps using its own
model account, subscription, or API setup.

## Quick Setup

1. Finish **Set Up Fennara** in the Godot dock.
2. Open **Chat Settings > MCP Apps**.
3. Find your app and press **Set Up**.
4. Restart the app.

Fennara creates a backup before changing an app's MCP configuration. The
combined **Claude** option configures Claude Code and Claude Desktop. **Gemini
& Antigravity** configures both shared targets.

### Terminal Alternative

Run `fennara install` inside the Godot project first, then choose a target:

| App | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code and Claude Desktop | `fennara mcp-setup --claude` |
| Claude Code only | `fennara mcp-setup --claude-code` |
| Claude Desktop only | `fennara mcp-setup --claude-desktop` |
| Codex | `fennara mcp-setup --codex` |
| Cursor | `fennara mcp-setup --cursor` |
| Gemini and Antigravity | `fennara mcp-setup --gemini` or `fennara mcp-setup --antigravity` |
| Cline | `fennara mcp-setup --cline` |
| VS Code | `fennara mcp-setup --vscode` |
| OpenCode | `fennara mcp-setup --opencode` |
| Windsurf | `fennara mcp-setup --windsurf` |
| Kiro | `fennara mcp-setup --kiro` |

Run `fennara mcp-setup --help` for the target list supported by your installed
CLI.

Setup writes a global, project-neutral launcher entry. Running `fennara
mcp-setup` inside a project does not bind every future connection to that
project.

## Bind A Connection To One Project

For multiple repositories or worktrees on the same machine, run one MCP process
and connection per project. Configure that process in the MCP host's project or
workspace settings with either:

```text
--project-path /absolute/path/to/godot-project
```

or:

```text
FENNARA_PROJECT_PATH=/absolute/path/to/godot-project
```

The runtime selects its Project Binding once at startup, in this order:

1. `--project-path`
2. `FENNARA_PROJECT_PATH`
3. the nearest startup-directory ancestor containing `project.godot`
4. legacy-unbound compatibility mode when discovery finds no project

An invalid explicit path prevents the MCP server from starting. It never falls
through to the dock target or another editor. A valid binding remains alive if
its editor is temporarily absent and recovers when that Project Root reconnects.
There is no model-facing, per-tool project override.

See [Multiple Agents And Worktrees](multi-agent-worktrees.md) for configuration
examples, host support boundaries, status verification, duplicate-editor
behavior, and serialized playtests.

## Manual Setup

Use manual setup only when your app is not listed, the setup command cannot find
the app's config file, or you intentionally want to edit MCP config by hand.

Before editing, make a backup of the config file. Then add a local stdio MCP
server named `fennara` that points at the stable Fennara MCP launcher.

Default launcher paths:

```text
Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Fennara\bin\fennara-mcp.exe
macOS:   ~/Library/Application Support/Fennara/bin/fennara-mcp
Linux:   ~/.local/share/fennara/bin/fennara-mcp
```

Use the real absolute path on your machine. Do not point MCP apps at
`versions/<version>/fennara-mcp-runtime`; the stable launcher in `bin/` keeps app
configs working across Fennara updates.

### JSON `mcpServers`

Many MCP apps use a top-level `mcpServers` object:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fennara": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\you\\AppData\\Local\\Fennara\\bin\\fennara-mcp.exe",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Some apps use the same `mcpServers` key but only require `command`. If the
existing config already has other servers, preserve those entries and add only
the `fennara` server.

For a project-local entry that must stay isolated, add its binding to `args`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fennara": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/fennara-mcp",
      "args": ["--project-path", "/absolute/path/to/godot-project"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Cline-style configs can also include a longer tool timeout in seconds:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fennara": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\you\\AppData\\Local\\Fennara\\bin\\fennara-mcp.exe",
      "args": [],
      "env": {},
      "timeout": 300
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code-Style JSON `servers`

Some clients, including VS Code user or project MCP config, use a top-level
`servers` object and require `type: "stdio"`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "fennara": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "C:\\Users\\you\\AppData\\Local\\Fennara\\bin\\fennara-mcp.exe",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### OpenCode-Style JSON `mcp`

OpenCode-style JSON config uses a top-level `mcp` object. Its timeout is in
milliseconds:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "fennara": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["C:\\Users\\you\\AppData\\Local\\Fennara\\bin\\fennara-mcp.exe"],
      "enabled": true,
      "timeout": 300000
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex-Style TOML

Codex uses TOML:

```toml
[mcp_servers.fennara]
command = "C:\\Users\\you\\AppData\\Local\\Fennara\\bin\\fennara-mcp.exe"
startup_timeout_sec = 30
tool_timeout_sec = 300
```

Do not paste JSON into a TOML file or TOML into a JSON file. Match the format
already used by the app.

To bind a Codex-style entry, add the argument without changing its stable
launcher:

```toml
[mcp_servers.fennara]
command = "/absolute/path/to/fennara-mcp"
args = ["--project-path", "/absolute/path/to/godot-project"]
startup_timeout_sec = 30
tool_timeout_sec = 300
```

## Common Config Locations

These are common locations used by Fennara's setup helper and by current MCP
clients. Apps can change their config paths, and some support both global and
project-local configs. If an app has a command such as **Open MCP Config**, use
that instead of guessing.

```text
Codex:          ~/.codex/config.toml
Cursor:         ~/.cursor/mcp.json
Cline:          ~/.cline/data/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json
VS Code:        user mcp.json or <project>/.vscode/mcp.json
Claude Code:    ~/.claude.json
Claude Desktop: macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
                Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
Gemini CLI:     ~/.gemini/settings.json
Antigravity:    ~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json or ~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json
OpenCode:       ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json
Windsurf:       ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
Kiro:           ~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json
```

VS Code single-folder workspaces may provide the project as the MCP child
process's startup directory. Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Cline,
Cursor, OpenCode, Kiro, and Codex can use project/workspace configuration; use
an explicit binding or a documented project startup directory when isolation
must be guaranteed.

Claude Desktop and legacy Windsurf/Cascade use global configuration for this
workflow. Their default setup remains legacy-unbound. Advanced users can create
separately named global entries with different explicit project paths, but
those apps do not provide automatic project-local isolation.

## Timeout Guidance

Some Fennara tools may take longer than a small default MCP timeout because they
can ask Godot to validate scenes, inspect runtime state, capture screenshots, or
run diagnostics.

Use a longer per-tool timeout when the client supports it:

```text
30 seconds for server startup
300 seconds for tool calls
300000 milliseconds for clients whose timeout field is in milliseconds
```

If a client does not support per-server timeouts, use that client's documented
global MCP timeout setting.

## Verify The Connection

Open the Godot project, then ask your MCP app:

```text
Use Fennara MCP to run fennara_status and tell me which Godot project is connected.
```

For isolated work, confirm that status reports routing mode `bound`, the
expected binding source and canonical Project Root, bound-editor state
`connected`, and that editor's filesystem readiness.

If status reports `legacy_unbound`, the connection found no automatic Project
Root. It uses the dock's **MCP target** compatibility route and warns that this
mode is unsafe for isolated concurrent work.

## Troubleshooting

If Fennara does not appear in the MCP app:

- confirm the launcher path is absolute and exists
- confirm the config syntax is valid JSON, JSON5, or TOML as required by the app
- confirm the server is named `fennara`
- confirm the app is reading the config file you edited
- fully quit and reopen the MCP app
- confirm the Godot project has the Fennara addon installed
- for a bound connection, confirm its explicit path or startup directory is the
  intended Godot Project Root
- if status reports `bound_project_not_connected`, open that project in Godot
  and wait for the addon to connect
- if status reports `ambiguous_project_binding`, close the duplicate editor or
  open it from a distinct worktree
- for a legacy-unbound connection, confirm the intended project is selected as
  the dock's MCP target

## Unsupported MCP Apps

If your MCP app is not listed, find that app's official MCP config location and
format first. Then ask an LLM for the smallest safe edit:

```text
I have a local stdio MCP server executable at:
<paste the full path to fennara-mcp here>

I want to add it to <app name>.
The app's MCP config file is:
<paste config path here>

The config format is <JSON/TOML/YAML/etc>.

Please show the smallest safe edit to add a server named "fennara".
Preserve all existing config. If the app needs "mcpServers", "servers", "mcp",
or another top-level key, use the key required by that app's official docs.
```

Review the result before saving, then restart the MCP app.
