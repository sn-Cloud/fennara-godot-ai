| Question | Short answer |
| --- | --- |
| Do I need a provider key? | Only for a cloud provider in the built-in chat |
| Can I use an external MCP app instead? | Yes, it uses its own model account |
| Does Fennara upload my project to a Fennara server? | No |
| Can multiple Godot editors be open? | Yes; bind each concurrent MCP connection to its own project |

## Is Fennara only a code generator?

No. Fennara is a Godot-aware agent workflow. It can work with project files, scenes, diagnostics, runtime errors, screenshots, and Godot editor context.

## Is Fennara just another Godot MCP command server?

No. MCP is one way to use Fennara from apps like Codex, Claude, Cursor, Gemini, and Antigravity. Fennara also has an optional built-in chat dock. The main product thesis is the Godot feedback loop: diagnostics, validation, runtime errors, screenshots, and structured tool results so agents can patch mistakes.

## Does Fennara replace Godot knowledge?

No. Fennara is not trying to make Godot optional. It is designed to make AI agents accountable to the real Godot engine.

## How should I install Fennara?

On Windows and Linux, add the addon, open the Fennara dock, and press **Set Up
Fennara**, or install from the terminal. On macOS, install through the CLI to
avoid the security notification that can occur when a browser-downloaded addon
ZIP is extracted manually. See [Setup](setup.md) for both paths.

## Why does macOS say it cannot verify `libfennara.macos.editor`?

The release addon contains a native library that is not currently
Apple-notarized. When the addon ZIP is downloaded through a browser and
extracted manually, Finder can propagate quarantine metadata to that library,
causing the macOS notification.

To avoid it, use the [CLI installation](setup.md#install-from-the-terminal-recommended-on-macos).
If the notification already appears, close Godot, remove the manually copied
`addons/fennara/` folder, install the CLI, and run `fennara install` from the
project directory. The CLI installs the same addon without that browser and
Finder quarantine path.

## Do I need a chat provider API key?

Only if you want to use a cloud provider in the built-in Fennara chat dock. External MCP clients use their own model/app configuration and can use Fennara MCP tools without putting any provider key into Fennara chat.

The built-in chat can also use local Ollama or LM Studio without a cloud API
key. See [Built-In Chat Providers](providers.md).

## Why does the dock ask for a provider if I already ran `mcp-setup --claude`?

`fennara mcp-setup --claude` connects Claude to Fennara's Godot MCP tools. It does not connect the built-in Fennara dock to Claude, and it does not share your Claude subscription with Fennara chat.

Use Claude Code or Claude Desktop for the external MCP flow. Configure a separate provider only if you want to chat inside Godot's Fennara dock. See [MCP Apps And Built-In Chat](chat-vs-mcp.md).

## What are `/provider` and `/model`?

They are slash commands in the built-in Fennara chat dock. `/provider` opens the provider picker. `/model` opens the model picker. They are UI shortcuts, not external MCP tools and not text sent to the model. See [Built-In Chat Slash Commands](slash-commands.md).

## Does Fennara send my Godot project to a Fennara server?

No. In the normal OSS path, the MCP client, daemon, and Godot addon run locally.
The built-in chat sends model requests only to the provider you configure, such
as OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Ollama Cloud, DeepSeek, Z.AI, Moonshot AI, Kimi For Coding, MiniMax, or a local Ollama/LM Studio server.

## Which project receives MCP tool calls if multiple Godot editors are open?

A project-bound MCP process routes every call to the connected editor for its
canonical Project Root. Use one MCP process and connection per project for
agents working concurrently in different repositories or worktrees.

An unbound MCP process preserves the compatibility behavior: the daemon uses
the dock-selected MCP Target, or the sole connected editor. Run
`fennara_status` before concurrent work and require routing mode `bound` with the
expected root. Built-in chat sessions stay bound to the editor that opened the
chat. See [Multiple Agents And Worktrees](multi-agent-worktrees.md).

## Can several agents run their games at the same time?

Not through daemon-managed Runtime Sessions. Editing, inspection, bounded scene
validation, and standalone screenshots may happen concurrently, but all
projects share one Runtime Slot for interactive managed game runs. A losing
start returns a normal anonymous `busy` result, so the agent can poll with
jitter and retry without disrupting the current run. The owning project keeps
its inactivity deadline renewed by polling status while the run proceeds; the
absolute lease deadline never moves.

## Why does Linux install a separate CEF runtime?

Linux embedded chat uses CEF off-screen rendering. The CEF payload is large, so
Fennara installs it once under the user's Fennara app-data directory instead of
copying it into every Godot project addon.

## Is the addon supposed to contain `libcef.so`?

No. `libcef.so`, CEF resources, locale packs, and the CEF helper belong in the
shared Linux CEF runtime. The addon should only contain the Godot addon files,
GDExtension binaries, chat UI files, and small bundled helper binaries such as
ripgrep.

## What if the built-in chat webview cannot start?

Fennara MCP tools still work. Only the optional in-editor chat dock needs the
platform webview. On Windows, install Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime if
`fennara doctor` reports it missing. On macOS, WKWebView comes from the system
WebKit.framework. On Linux, run `fennara update` so the release-managed CEF
runtime can be installed or repaired.

You can also use the Chat Settings option **Open chat in my system browser next
time**. That keeps the same built-in Fennara chat and provider settings, but
opens the UI through the local daemon in your system browser instead of the
embedded Godot webview. Restart Godot after changing the setting.

## Does opening chat in my browser use Claude or my MCP app?

No. Browser display is only a UI/runtime choice for the built-in Fennara chat.
It still uses the provider selected in Fennara chat settings. `fennara
mcp-setup --claude` and similar commands configure external MCP apps; they do
not configure the built-in chat model.

## Does `fennara update` rewrite MCP app config?

No. `fennara update` refreshes the installed CLI when needed, the project
addon, local runtime package, generated project guidance, and platform-managed
runtime assets. Run `fennara mcp-setup` again only when setting up or repairing
an MCP app config.

## Where does chat history live?

Chat history is stored locally by the daemon and scoped to the current Godot
project. Provider keys and local provider URLs are also stored locally by the
daemon, outside the Godot project.

## What should agents use Fennara tools for?

Use Fennara for Godot-aware feedback: scene trees, changed node/resource
properties, diagnostics, validation, runtime sessions, screenshots, and editor
debugger state. MCP clients should still use their own ordinary file
read/search tools unless a Fennara-specific tool is needed.
